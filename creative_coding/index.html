    <h1>My Portfolio</h1>
    <p>Welcome to my creative coding portfolio! I'm a third-year student at Fordham University, where I study New Media and Digital Design with a concentration on information. This site features projects that show my new skills in technology and art, demonstrating how I've learned to use digital tools to create new and engaging forms of expression. </p>
